<summary>🙋 Having trouble?</summary><br/>

If you run into any issues while copying the repository, try these tips:

- **Owner**: Choose either your personal GitHub account or an organization you belong to.
- **Visibility**: We recommend setting it to **public** to avoid consuming GitHub Actions minutes on a private repo.

If it's taking longer than 20 seconds:
- Go to the [Actions](../../actions) tab to see if a job is running.
- If there’s a failed job, feel free to open an issue — congrats, you may have found a bug! 🐞
